# Locate SDL2_mixer library
# This module defines
# SDL2_MIXER_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
# SDL2_MIXER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL2_mixer
# SDL2_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL_mixer.h
#
# $SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR
# used in building SDL2.
# l.e.galup  9-20-02
#
# Modified by Eric Wing.
# Added code to assist with automated building by using environmental variables
# and providing a more controlled/consistent search behavior.
# Added new modifications to recognize OS X frameworks and
# additional Unix paths (FreeBSD, etc).
# Also corrected the header search path to follow "proper" SDL guidelines.
# Added a search for SDL2_mixer which is needed by some platforms.
# Added a search for SDL2_mixer which is needed by some platforms.
#
# For backward compatiblity the upper case versions of the variables are also defined
# SDL2_MIXER_LIBRARY, the name of the library to link against
# SDL2_MIXER_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to SDL2_mixer
# SDL2_MIXER_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find SDL_mixer.h
#
# $SDL2DIR is an environment variable that would
# correspond to the ./configure --prefix=$SDL2DIR
# used in building SDL2.

# Created by Eric Wing.
# This was influenced by the FindSDL.cmake module.
